## Introduction

Videos often have large file sizes, which can be problematic for various reasons such as limited storage space, slow upload/download speeds, or bandwidth constraints. Video compression techniques help reduce the file size of videos without significant loss of quality. This project aims to provide a solution for video compression that balances file size and visual fidelity.

## Installation

List the necessary dependencies and provide instructions on how to install them. Include any specific requirements, such as software versions or system configurations.


## import ffmpeg

input_file = 'input.mp4'
output_file = 'output.mp4'

##  ffmpeg.input(input_file).output(output_file, crf=23).run()

In this example, we use the ffmpeg library to compress a video. The crf parameter specifies the Constant Rate Factor, which controls the trade-off between file size and quality. You can experiment with different values to find the desired compression level.
