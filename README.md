## Introduction

Videos often have large file sizes, which can be problematic for various reasons such as limited storage space, slow upload/download speeds, or bandwidth constraints. Video compression techniques help reduce the file size of videos without significant loss of quality. This project aims to provide a solution for video compression that balances file size and visual fidelity.

## Installation

List the necessary dependencies and provide instructions on how to install them. Include any specific requirements, such as software versions or system configurations.


import ffmpeg

input_file = 'input.mp4'
output_file = 'output.mp4'

ffmpeg.input(input_file).output(output_file, crf=23).run()



```bash
$ 

Follow the on-screen instructions to select the desired compression settings and specify the output directory.

Sit back and relax while the tool compresses your videos. The progress will be displayed for each file.

Once the compression is complete, you can find the compressed videos in the specified output directory.

Customization

You can customize the compression settings by modifying the compress.py file. Feel free to adjust the following parameters according to your preferences:

RESOLUTION: Set the desired output resolution (e.g., "1280x720", "1920x1080").

BITRATE: Define the target bitrate for video compression (e.g., "1000k", "2000k").

FRAME_RATE: Specify the output frame rate (e.g., "30", "60").
