Video Compression Too




Video Compression Tool

This is a video compression tool that allows you to reduce the size of your video files without significant loss in quality. It utilizes advanced compression algorithms to optimize video data and make it more storage-friendly. This README file provides instructions on how to use the tool and additional information about the features it offers.

Features

Video Compression: Compresses video files to reduce their size while maintaining reasonable video quality.

Multiple Formats: Supports a wide range of video formats including MP4, AVI, MKV, and more.

Customizable Settings: Allows you to adjust compression settings such as resolution, bitrate, and frame rate to achieve the desired balance between file size and quality.

Batch Compression: Enables you to compress multiple video files in one go, saving time and effort.

Progress Tracking: Provides real-time progress updates during the compression process.

Preserves Metadata: Retains important metadata such as video duration, title, and artist information.

Easy-to-Use Interface: Offers a simple and intuitive command-line interface for hassle-free usage.

Requirements

Python 3.x

FFmpeg library

Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash

Copy code

git clone https://github.com/your-username/video-compression-tool.git

Install the required Python packages:

Copy code

pip install -r requirements.txt

Install FFmpeg library:

Copy code

brew install ffmpeg

For Ubuntu:

arduino

Copy code

sudo apt-get install ffmpeg

For Windows:

Download FFmpeg from the official website (https://ffmpeg.org/) and add it to your system's PATH.

Usage

Navigate to the project directory:

bash

Copy code

cd video-compression-tool

Place your video files that need compression in the input directory.

Run the following command to start the compression process:

Copy code

python compress.py

Follow the on-screen instructions to select the desired compression settings and specify the output directory.

Sit back and relax while the tool compresses your videos. The progress will be displayed for each file.

Once the compression is complete, you can find the compressed videos in the specified output directory.

Customization

You can customize the compression settings by modifying the compress.py file. Feel free to adjust the following parameters according to your preferences:

RESOLUTION: Set the desired output resolution (e.g., "1280x720", "1920x1080").

BITRATE: Define the target bitrate for video compression (e.g., "1000k", "2000k").

FRAME_RATE: Specify the output frame rate (e.g., "30", "60").
